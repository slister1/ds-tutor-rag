One approach is to discard observations that have any missing values. However, this should be avoided if the relative amount of missing data is large. Another approach is to rely on the learning algorithm to handle missing values during its training phase. CART, MARS, and PRIM are examples of learning algorithms that effectively deal with missing values through surrogate splits. Generalized additive modeling omits observations missing for a given input feature when smoothing the partial residuals, and their fitted values are set to zero. The simplest tactic is to impute missing values with the mean or median of the nonmissing values for that feature. If the features have some degree of dependence, a predictive model can be estimated for each feature given the other features, and missing values can be imputed using the predictions from the model. The choice of the learning method for imputation should be distinct from the method used for predicting the target variable. CART is an ideal choice for imputation when there are many missing feature values in the training set. After imputation, missing values are typically treated as if they were actually observed, ignoring the uncertainty introduced by imputation.

One of the key factors is the democratization of the toolsets used in the field. In the early days, deep learning required significant expertise in C++ and CUDA, which limited its accessibility. However, with the development of user-friendly libraries such as Keras and frameworks like TensorFlow, deep learning has become more accessible to a wider audience, including startups, graduate students, and researchers. This has led to an influx of new faces in the field and a wave of investment.\n\nAnother reason for the popularity of deep learning is its properties that justify its status as an AI revolution. Deep learning removes the need for feature engineering, simplifying the implementation of new models. It is highly scalable and can take full advantage of parallelization on GPUs or TPUs, allowing it to train on datasets of arbitrary size. Deep learning models are also versatile and reusable, making them viable for continuous online learning and allowing previous work to be reinvested into more complex models.\n\nFurthermore, advancements in algorithmic improvements, such as better activation functions, weight initialization schemes, and optimization schemes, have enabled the training of deep neural networks with 10 or more layers. This has unlocked the use of extremely large models with considerable representational power, leading to critical advances in computer vision and natural language processing.\n\nOverall, the combination of the democratization of toolsets, the properties of deep learning, and advancements in algorithmic improvements have contributed to the popularity of deep learning in recent times.\n\nSource:\n- Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition by Fran\u00e7ois Chollet: https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition/discussion", "metadata": {}}

They have been shown to achieve cutting-edge performance on several learning tasks. A neural network can be described as a directed graph, where the nodes correspond to neurons and the edges correspond to links between them. Each neuron receives a weighted sum of the outputs of the neurons connected to its incoming edges as input. The focus is on feedforward networks, which do not contain cycles in the underlying graph. The size of a neural network is determined by the number of nodes in it. The family of hypothesis classes of neural networks of polynomial size can be used for practical learning tasks, as they have a polynomial sample complexity and minimal approximation error among all hypothesis classes consisting of efficiently implementable predictors. However, training such hypothesis classes of neural network predictors is computationally hard. A widely used heuristic for training neural networks is the SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) framework.

The goal is to find the bottom of the valley. To do this, you would touch the ground around you and move in the direction where the ground is sloping down the most steeply. You would continue taking steps in that direction until the ground becomes flat, indicating that you have reached the bottom of the valley. In mathematics, the ground represents the loss function, and the elevation at the bottom of the valley represents the minimum of that function. Gradient descent uses the negative gradient (slope) of the loss function as a descent direction to iteratively update the model's parameters and minimize the loss.

The likelihood function is a mathematical equation that measures how closely the predicted probabilities match the observed data. Logistic regression is commonly used for binary classification, but it can also be used for classification with multiple categories. \n\nSource: \n- Machine Learning for Humans: Logistic regression: 0 or 1?\n- Part 2.2: Supervised Learning II, 4.3 Logistic Regression 135", "metadata": {}}

One way is to add penalization terms to the loss function to make it cheaper for the model to behave more smoothly and change more slowly between data points. Another approach is to add noise to the input samples, creating artificial data points between training data samples and forcing the model to fit them as well. Additionally, you can make your model simpler, as a simpler model is more likely to behave regularly between data points. It's important to find a balance between having enough capacity for the model to fit the training set and avoiding overfitting.

It is a problem-solving technique employed in various fields, including engineering, healthcare, business, and quality management. The goal of root cause analysis is to find the fundamental reason(s) behind an issue rather than merely addressing its symptoms. By identifying and addressing the root cause, organizations can prevent the problem from recurring in the future. The RCA process typically involves the following steps: Problem Identification: Clearly define the problem or the undesired event that needs to be investigated. This could be a defect, failure, error, accident, or any other issue that impacts the normal functioning of a system or process. Data Collection: Gather relevant data and information related to the problem. This data may include incident reports, observations, measurements, customer feedback, and any other relevant data sources. Root Cause Analysis Techniques: Use various analytical methods and tools to examine the data and identify potential causes of the problem. Some common RCA techniques include: Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram): Helps identify potential causes by categorizing them into different groups, such as people, processes, equipment, materials, and environment. 5 Whys: Repeatedly asking \"why\" to dig deeper into the causes behind the initial problem. Pareto Analysis: Identifying the most significant factors contributing to the problem by applying the Pareto principle (80/20 rule). Fault Tree Analysis (FTA): Analyzing the logical relationships between multiple causes and their contribution to the problem. Identify the Root Cause(s): Based on the analysis, identify the main cause or causes that led to the problem. The root cause is the core reason, and addressing it will prevent the recurrence of the issue. Implement Corrective Actions: Once the root cause is identified, develop and implement effective corrective actions to eliminate or mitigate the problem. These actions aim to fix the root cause rather than just treating the symptoms. Monitor and Verify: After implementing corrective actions, monitor the system or process to ensure that the problem has been resolved. Verify the effectiveness of the solutions by assessing the data and evaluating whether the problem has been eliminated or reduced. Root cause analysis is a valuable problem-solving tool that promotes continuous improvement and helps organizations identify and address the fundamental issues that may hinder their performance, safety, or overall quality.", "metadata": {}}
