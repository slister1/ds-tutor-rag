Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS Org) is an open research organization founded by students and faculty from UC Berkeley in collaboration with UCSD and CMU.

We borrowed our evaluation approach from their blog (https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) comparing Vicuna open source chatbot with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo)

Please see their repo (https://github.com/lm-sys/vicuna-blog-eval) for more details on the question and answer file formats, as well as how to leverage GPT-4 to evaluate and score the responses.
